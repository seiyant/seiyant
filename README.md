## Hi there 👋

My name is **Seiya**, and I'm an **Electrical Engineering student at UBC**. 

Here, you’ll find some **public projects** I’ve contributed to!

### Current Project
Currently working on a **computer vision project** for **marker detection** in **computer-assisted surgery** (focused on **mandibular cancer surgery**). 

Collaborating with the **ISTAR group** at Vancouver General Hospital, we're using **OpenCV** and **3D Slicer** to make a **high-resolution angle sensor**. 

The goal is to help surgeons achieve precise positioning and angle measurements. 🩺
