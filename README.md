## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Seiya**, and I'm a recent **Electrical Engineering graduate** from **UBC**. 

Here, youâ€™ll find some **public projects** Iâ€™ve contributed to!

### Recent Project
My final year **Capstone** project implemented **computer vision** in computer-assisted surgery (focusing on **jaw surgery**, dealing with mandibular cancers). 

Collaborating with the ISTAR group at the Vancouver General Hospital and with the help of UBC Graduate students, we used **OpenCV** and **3D Slicer** to create a cheap alternative to a high-resolution angle sensor. 

We hope our research and testing will help surgeons achieve precise positioning and angle measurements. ðŸ©º
