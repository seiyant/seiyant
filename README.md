## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Seiya**, and I'm an **Electrical Engineering** student at **UBC**. 

Here, youâ€™ll find some **public projects** Iâ€™ve contributed to!

### Current Project
I'm currently working on a **computer vision project** in computer-assisted surgery (focusing on **jaw surgery** for mandibular cancers). 

Collaborating with the ISTAR group at the Vancouver General Hospital, we're using **OpenCV** and **3D Slicer** to make a high-resolution angle sensor. 

The goal is to help surgeons achieve precise positioning and angle measurements. ðŸ©º
