## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on a **computer vision project** for **marker detection** in **computer-assisted surgery**, focused on **jaw surgery** for treating **mandibular cancers**. This project, in collaboration with the **ISTAR group** at Vancouver General Hospital, uses **OpenCV** and **3D Slicer** to support surgeons in achieving precise positioning and angle measurements. Our goal is to develop a **high-resolution angle sensor** that uses computer vision to analyze marker patterns, providing accurate measurements of position and orientation to enhance surgical precision and usability. ðŸ©º

### A little about me
I'm an **Electrical Engineering student at UBC**. Here are some **public projects** I've contributed to and a few I'm currently working on!

Feel free to reach out!
