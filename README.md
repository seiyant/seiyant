## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Seiya**, and I'm an **Electrical Engineering student at UBC**. 

Here, youâ€™ll find some **public projects** Iâ€™ve contributed to!

### Current Project
I'm currently working on a **computer vision project** for **marker detection** in **computer-assisted surgery** (focused on **jaw surgery** for **mandibular cancers**). 

In collaboration with the **ISTAR group** at Vancouver General Hospital, we're using **OpenCV** and **3D Slicer** to develop a **high-resolution angle sensor**. 

This system helps surgeons achieve precise positioning and angle measurements, enhancing surgical accuracy and usability. ðŸ©º

Feel free to reach out!
