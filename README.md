## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on a **computer vision project** for **marker detection** in **computer-assisted surgery** (focused on **jaw surgery** for **mandibular cancers**). 

In collaboration with the **ISTAR group** at Vancouver General Hospital, we're using **OpenCV** and **3D Slicer** to develop a **high-resolution angle sensor**. 

This system helps surgeons achieve precise positioning and angle measurements, enhancing surgical accuracy and usability. ðŸ©º

### A little about me
I'm an **Electrical Engineering student at UBC**. 

Here are some **public projects** I've contributed to and a few I'm currently working on!

Feel free to reach out!
